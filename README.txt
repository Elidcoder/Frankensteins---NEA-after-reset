This is a desktop app that allows for the creation of D&D 5e characters, custom spells and the importing of others content. The focus of this project was to create an easy to use, free and open source software for the creation of D&D characters. The project was started for my computer science A - Level NEA.

This is stil a work in progress with summer goals of:
  - Refactoring the code to make better use of the character class
  - Giving the option for more custom creations such as classes, armours etc. 
  - Adding further functionality to the echo feature to allow you to use the app to play D&D as well as make characters
  - Reformating pages to create an IPhone & Android version of the app
