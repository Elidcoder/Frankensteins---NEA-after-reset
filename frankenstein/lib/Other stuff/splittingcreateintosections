TO do:
EQUIPMENT FUNCTIONAL
FIX THE BACKGROUNDS (ADD EQUIP AND FIX LANGUAGES)
ADD THE PARSER TO THE RACE
GET A REQUIREMENT FUNCTION GOING FOR THINGS E.G. AC, EQUIP ETC..
a parser to take in a set like "intelligence + 2" and decode it at sheet creation
DEAL WITH ROGUE (S)VS OPTIONAL S FOR PROFFESSIONAL LOOK
multiple gains from a single array 
fix >2 choice stacks
spacers for neater UI
hovers to everything
correct parser at all for things gained
isAllowedContend returns allowed content


small:
Pass in variables to recursive building without the ? stuff
main page should be centered
basics menu needs to be mega fixed
ability scores should be main/cross axis aligned
many issues with the race page and lacks of features
custom background
mystery lists need to be swapped for functional code that isn't hogging memory
Feats:
ASI list (if even) total numb and feats have maximum numb
Subclasses:
store a future area
