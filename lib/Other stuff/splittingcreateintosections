TO do:
EQUIPMENT FUNCTIONAL
FIX THE BACKGROUNDS (ADD EQUIP AND FIX LANGUAGES)
ADD THE PARSER TO THE RACE
GET A REQUIREMENT FUNCTION GOING FOR THINGS E.G. AC, EQUIP ETC..
a parser to take in a set like "intelligence + 2" and decode it at sheet creation
DEAL WITH ROGUE (S)VS OPTIONAL S FOR PROFFESSIONAL LOOK
multiple gains from a single array 
fix >2 choice stacks
spacers for neater UI
hovers to everything
correct parser at all for things gained
isAllowedContend returns allowed content


small:
equipment multiple coin types, 
edit character section needs to be brought up to date,
complete feat descriptions so it isn't just bonuses, 
level 1 bonuses ?
double levels per class
points remaining shouldn't be passed in also feats remaining once the checks are in place
spells should have a shourcebook
spells allowed users should be updated as classes/subclasses are added
also future subclasses
ASI screen should show modifiers produced
using classlist 
subrace is missing in something
starting with languages as well as being able to choose some
magic items and notes to classes
ensure that classes actually use a list of equipment
class starting wealth
Pass in variables to recursive building without the ? stuff
textboxes go blue when info entered
update spell and parents and stuff
main page should be centered
basics menu needs to be mega fixed
ability scores should be main/cross axis aligned
many issues with the race page and lacks of features
custom background
mystery lists need to be swapped for functional code that isn't hogging memory
requirements nedd to be added - takeable function
Feats:
make sure that ASI max works
make sure choices within feats work, and sort by options selected
Subclasses:
store a future area
Spells:
Spells bloc stuff - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51798498/flutter-setstate-to-another-class/51798698#51798698
also please actually decode at some point and also for all skill increases
