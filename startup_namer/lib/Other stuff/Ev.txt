End Checklist:
togglebuttons use more, singlewhere and WHERE should be used later
BDS liscence
Pass the sourcebook as an input into the actual creation itself later
also deal with tthe abilities in the background for outputting the pdf
also remove all unnecessary returns with .. / ... and add static/final more
change the toggle buttons to look more in theme

Notes:
'Feature' where reselecting the same item resets everything
